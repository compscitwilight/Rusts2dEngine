# Classes Folder
The classes folder contains a subfolder named "core". It is recommended to not edit any classes in the folder.

If you're editing to contribute, please thouroughly check for bugs or conflicts with other classes that the class may
originally worked with.

It is also recommended that your own custom classes are kept inside of the /classes folder, and not inside of /classes/core.
